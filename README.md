Video game construction using HTML, Javascript. 

## Game Description
This game will be called "Mokepon". It's a very simple game, where we fight using different characters (fire, water, earth)

# HTML markups guide
* < strong > This is for Bolding text < /strong >
* **< meta charset="utf-8" />**: This allows to add Ã± and special characters
* **Creating a button:**
    * the correct way of creating a button is putting the **button** markup inside a paragraph markup: 

    < p > < button > This is a button </ button > < /p >

# JAVASCRIPT Notes 
* **Creating a variable:** use the prefix let and then declare the variable (let variable_name = 1)
* **Ask the user to entry a variable:** use the "prompt" command. ej. *name = prompt("what's your name?")*
